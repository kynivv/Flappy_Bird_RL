# Summary #
This project is a fun demonstration of a reinforcement learning (RL) model applied to the classic Flappy Bird game. The repository includes the Flappy Bird game made from scratch using *PyGame* and training of the reinforcement model with 100 agents. The project was primarily made to demonstrate the capabilities of reinforcement learning models entertainingly.

# Installation #
For installation, please download all the requirements from the requirements.txt and make sure you are using Python 3.12

# Key Features: #
**Game Implementation:** A replica of the Flappy Bird game built using Python and Pygame.

**Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Utilizes Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with a FeedForwardNetwork to train an AI agent to navigate through the game.

**Training Scripts:** Includes scripts for training the RL model, saving checkpoints, and evaluating performance.

**Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the training process and agent performance.
