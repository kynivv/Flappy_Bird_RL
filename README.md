# Summary #
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the classic Flappy Bird game. The primary objectives include training an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using RL techniques and providing a playable version of the game for testing and demonstration purposes.

# Key Features: #
**Game Implementation:** A replica of the Flappy Bird game built using Python and Pygame.

**Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Utilizes Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with a FeedForwardNetwork to train an AI agent to navigate through the game.

**Training Scripts:** Includes scripts for training the RL model, saving checkpoints, and evaluating performance.

**Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the training process and agent performance.
